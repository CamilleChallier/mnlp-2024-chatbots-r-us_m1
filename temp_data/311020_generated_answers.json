This means that a message is sent to all processes without any acknowledgment.\n\n2. **Acknowledgment Mechanism:** After broadcasting a message using BEB, each process that receives the message sends an acknowledgment back to the sender.\n\n3. **Reliable Delivery:** The sender waits for acknowledgments from all processes before delivering the message to its local application. If an acknowledgment is not received within a reasonable timeout period, the sender can resend the message.\n\n4. **Duplicate Detection:** To handle duplicate messages, each process can keep track of the sequence numbers of messages it has received. If a process receives a message with a sequence number it has already seen, it can ignore the message to prevent duplicate delivery.\n\nHere is a pseudo-code implementation of the algorithm:\n\n```python\n# Initialization\nreceived_messages = {}  # Dictionary to store received messages' sequence numbers\n\n# BestEffort-Broadcast function\ndef BEB_Broadcast(message):\n    for process in all_processes:\n        send_message(process, message)\n\n# Reliable_Broadcast function\ndef Reliable_Broadcast(message):\n    BEB_Broadcast(message)\n    wait_for_acknowledgments()\n\n# Acknowledgment handling function\ndef wait_for_acknowledgments():\n    received_ack_count = 0\n    expected_ack_count = len(all_processes)\n    \n    while received_ack_count < expected_ack_count:\n        ack_message = receive_message()\n        if is_acknowledgment(ack_message):\n            received_ack_count += 1\n\n# Message handling function\ndef handle_message(message):\n    if message.sequence_number not in received_messages:\n        received_messages[message.sequence_number] = message\n        Reliable_Broadcast(message)\n\n# Main function for process\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        message = receive_message()\n        handle_message(message)\n\n# Process initialization\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis algorithm ensures reliable broadcast by using acknowledgments to confirm message delivery and prevent duplicates.

By measuring the time it takes to access certain memory locations, the attacker can infer information about the victim's code, such as which memory locations are being accessed and potentially sensitive information being processed.

        "B": "A Prime+Probe cache attack is a type of side-channel attack that exploits the shared cache of modern processors to leak information about the victim's code execution. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works and what information it can reveal:\n\n1. **Priming Phase**: In the priming phase, the attacker fills the cache with their own data by accessing a specific set of memory locations. This causes the cache lines to be loaded with the attacker's data, pushing the victim's data out of the cache.\n\n2. **Probe Phase**: In the probe phase, the attacker monitors the cache access times to determine if specific cache lines are present or not. By accessing the same memory locations as in the priming phase and measuring the access times, the attacker can infer whether the cache lines were evicted (indicating that the victim's data was loaded) or remain in the cache (indicating that the victim's data was not present).\n\n3. **Repeating the Attack**: The attacker repeats the priming and probing steps multiple times, each time targeting different memory locations related to the victim's code or data. By analyzing the access times and presence of cache lines, the attacker can deduce patterns and information about the victim's code execution.\n\n4. **Information Revealed**: A Prime+Probe cache attack can reveal sensitive information such as memory access patterns, control flow behavior, and even specific data values accessed by the victim code. This information can be used to infer encryption keys, cryptographic operations, passwords, or other confidential data processed by the victim application.\n\nOverall, Prime+Probe cache attacks can be powerful and stealthy, as they exploit the low-level behavior of the processor's cache without requiring direct access to the victim's data. To defend against such attacks, countermeasures such as cache partitioning, randomizing memory access patterns, or introducing noise in cache access times can be implemented to mitigate the leakage of sensitive information."

Similarly, when applying scanLeft1 on the reversed sequence $a_N, \\ldots, a_1$, the function $f$ is applied from left to right, starting from the first element and moving towards the last element. \n\nSince the function $f$ is associative, the result of combining elements using $f$ will be the same regardless of the direction in which the elements are processed.

This algorithm would need to allow processes to deliver messages in any order as long as the causal relationship is maintained. Process pi would only deliver a message m2 once it has delivered all messages m1 that causally precede m2. This way, the causal order of messages is preserved without strictly enforcing the causal delivery property.",
        "B": "Yes, we can devise a broadcast algorithm that does not ensure the causal delivery property but only the non-uniform variant you described. Here's a high-level overview of how such an algorithm could work:\n\n1. Each process maintains a vector clock that tracks the ordering of message deliveries from other processes.\n2. When a process wants to broadcast a message, it includes its current vector clock in the message.\n3. Upon receiving a broadcast message, a process updates its vector clock to reflect the ordering of message deliveries.\n4. Before delivering a message, a process checks its vector clock to ensure that it has already delivered all preceding messages in the causal ordering.\n5. If the process has not yet delivered all preceding messages, it buffers the message until it satisfies the non-uniform causal delivery property.\n\nThis algorithm ensures that no correct process delivers a message unless it has already delivered every preceding message in the causal ordering, as specified in the non-uniform variant. However, it does not guarantee that messages are delivered in the exact order they were sent, as the causal delivery property would require."

This clustering should not only be achieved\nbased on the purchase history of customers, but should also be refined by the content of the books\nthemselves. It's that latter aspect we want to address in this exam question.\n\nThe chosen clustering algorithm is the dendrogram. What other algorithms could you propose\nfor the same task? Briefly review advantages and disadvantages of each of them (including\ndendrograms). Which one would you recommend for the targeted task?",

        "A": "Dendrogram is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that builds a tree-like structure to represent the relationship between data points. Other algorithms that could be considered for the same task of clustering books based on customer and content similarities include:\n\n1. K-means clustering: This algorithm partitions data into K clusters based on the mean of the data points. Advantages include its simplicity and efficiency, but it may not perform well with non-linear data distribution.\n\n2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This algorithm groups together points that are closely packed, while marking outliers as noise. It is robust to outliers and can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes, but may struggle with clusters of varying densities.\n\n3. Hierarchical clustering: Similar to dendrogram, hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters. It can be divisive (top-down) or agglomerative (bottom-up). Advantages include its ability to show the relationships between clusters at different levels, but it can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n\nFor the task of clustering books based on customer and content similarities, I would recommend hierarchical clustering. This algorithm can effectively capture the hierarchical structure of the data, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between books. Additionally, the ability to visually represent the clusters at different levels can provide valuable insights for making recommendations to customers.",
        "B": "There are several clustering algorithms that could be considered for the task of grouping books based on both customer preferences and book content similarities. Here are a few alternative clustering algorithms to consider in addition to dendrograms:\n\n1. K-Means Clustering:\n- **Advantages**:\n    - Simple and easy to implement.\n    - Computationally efficient for large datasets.\n- **Disadvantages**:\n    - Requires the number of clusters to be specified beforehand.\n    - Sensitive to initial cluster centers.\n- **Recommendation**: K-Means may not be the best choice for this task as it assumes spherical clusters and may not capture complex relationships between books and customers.\n\n2. Hierarchical Clustering:\n- **Advantages**:\n    - Does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance.\n    - Can reveal the hierarchy of clusters.\n- **Disadvantages**:\n    - Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n    - Not suitable for very large datasets.\n- **Recommendation**: Hierarchical clustering could be a good alternative to dendrograms as it can capture both book content and customer preferences in a hierarchical manner.\n\n3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n- **Advantages**:\n    - Can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes.\n    - Robust to noise and outliers.\n- **Disadvantages**:\n    - Requires tuning of hyperparameters.\n    - Not suitable for clusters of varying densities.\n- **Recommendation**: DBSCAN could be a good choice if there is noise in the dataset or if clusters have varying densities.\n\n4. Mean Shift Clustering:\n- **Advantages**:\n    - Can identify clusters of various shapes and sizes.\n    - Does not require the number of clusters to be specified.\n- **Disadvantages**:\n    - Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n    - Sensitivity to bandwidth parameter.\n- **Recommendation**: Mean Shift could be a good choice if you want to capture complex relationships between books and customers without assuming any specific cluster shapes.\n\nIn conclusion, for the targeted task of clustering books based on both customer preferences and book content similarities, a combination of Hierarchical Clustering and Dendrograms could be a suitable choice. Hierarchical clustering can capture the complex relationships between books and customers, while dendrograms can provide a visual representation of the clustering results. It is important to consider the specific requirements of the project and the characteristics of the dataset before choosing the most appropriate clustering algorithm."

The natural LP relaxation  (as seen in class) is as follows: \\begin{align*} \\textbf{minimize} \\hspace{0.4cm} & \\sum_{i\\in V} w(i) x_i \\\\ \\textbf{subject to}\\hspace{0.4cm} &  x_i + x_j \\geq 1 \\qquad \\mbox{for $\\{i,j\\} \\in E$}\\\\ & \\hspace{0.9cm}  x_i  \\geq 0 \\qquad \\mbox{for $i\\in V$} \\end{align*} Given a fractional solution $x$ to the above linear program, a natural approach to solve the vertex cover problem is to give a rounding algorithm. Indeed, in class we  analyzed a simple rounding scheme: output the vertex cover  $S = \\{i\\in V: x_i \\geq 1/2\\}$.  We proved that $w(S) \\leq 2 \\sum_{i\\in V} w(i) x_i$. In this subproblem, your task is to prove that the following alternative randomized rounding scheme give the same guarantee in expectation. The randomized rounding scheme is as follows: \\begin{itemize} \\item Select $t \\in [0,1/2]$ uniformly at  random. \\item Output $S_t = \\{i\\in V: x_i \\geq t\\}$. \\end{itemize} Prove (i) that the output $S_t$ is a feasible vertex cover solution (for any $t\\in [0,1/2]$) and (ii) that $\\E[\\sum_{i\\in S_t} w(i)] \\leq 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i\\in V} w(i) x_i$ where the expectation is over the random choice of $t$.  We remark that you \\emph{cannot} say that $x$ is half-integral as $x$ may not be an extreme point solution to the linear program. \\\\ {\\em (In this problem you are asked to prove that the randomized rounding scheme (i) always outputs a feasible solution and (ii) the expected cost of the output solution is at most twice the cost of the linear programming solution. Recall that you are allowed to refer to material covered in the lecture notes.)}",

This could ultimately harm the public's perception of the information provided and impact their decision-making process regarding their health and safety.\n\nTherefore, while AI technology can be a powerful tool for automation and efficiency, it is essential to supplement it with human oversight, editing, and input to ensure that the content created maintains a human-centered approach and effectively addresses the needs and concerns of the audience."

        "B": "To determine which of the given snippets can be used as a gadget and can be chained with more gadgets in a ROP/JOP chain, we need to consider the characteristics of a useful gadget in this context.\n\nA useful gadget for ROP/JOP chaining typically includes instructions that modify the control flow (such as changing the instruction pointer or jumping to a different location), load values into registers, or perform other useful operations.\n\nLet's analyze each snippet:\n\n1. \\texttt{pop rbx; pop rax; jmp rax}\n    - This snippet pops values into the rbx and rax registers and then jumps to the address stored in the rax register. This can be used as a gadget for loading values into registers and changing the control flow. It can be chained with more gadgets by setting the rax register to point to the next gadget.\n    \n2. \\texttt{pop rbx; pop rax; ret}\n    - This snippet pops values into the rbx and rax registers and then returns.

It can also be chained with more gadgets by setting the rax register to point to the next gadget.\n    \n4. \\texttt{xor rbx, rbx; xor rbx, -1; push rbx; ret}\n    - This snippet performs XOR operations on rbx, pushes the result onto the stack, and then returns. While this snippet sets rbx to -1, it does not directly modify the control flow in a useful way. It may not be as versatile for chaining with other gadgets.\n\nBased on the analysis, the snippets that can be used as a gadget and can be chained with more gadgets in a ROP/JOP chain are:\n- \\texttt{pop rbx; pop rax; jmp rax}\n- \\texttt{mov eax, -1; call rax}\n\nThese snippets provide more flexibility for modifying registers and controlling the flow of execution in a ROP/JOP chain."

        "B": "To perform dendrogram clustering on the given documents using cosine similarity and single linkage, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Tokenization and Vectorization**:\n   - Tokenize each document into individual words and create a binary vector representation for each document based on the presence of the words 'pen' and 'cow'. The vector representation will be as follows:\n     - d1: [1, 1]\n     - d2: [1, 0]\n     - d3: [1, 1]\n     - d4: [1, 1]\n     - d5: [1, 1]\n     - d6: [1, 1]\n\n2. **Calculate Cosine Similarity**:\n   - Calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of documents using the binary vector representations. Cosine similarity is calculated as the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes.\n   - For example, the cosine similarity between d1 and d2:\n     - Cosine(d1, d2) = (1 * 1 + 0 * 1) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(1)) = 1 / sqrt(2)\n   - Calculate cosine similarity for all pairs of documents.\n\n3. **Create Dendrogram**:\n   - Start by treating each document as a separate cluster.\n   - At each step, merge the two closest clusters based on the cosine similarity and single linkage criterion.

Having learned from its mistakes, the crow is determined not to be fooled again by the fox's flattery. The fox, however, is set on getting a second piece of cheese. This time , it chooses a more direct method and throws a stone at the crow to scare it. It works beyond expectations: as soon as the stone is thrown, the crow drops the cheese.\nThe crow is perched on a tree of height $H$; the fox is a distance $L$ from the base of the tree. The stone's initial speed is $v_0$.\nShow that the stone and the cheese will collide and compute the time at which the collision happens. Does that result depend on $g$? Explain why.\n",

The horizontal distance traveled by the stone is given by $L = v_0 \\cdot t$, and the vertical distance traveled by the stone is given by $H = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g \\cdot t^2$. \n\nSince the stone and the cheese collide at the same time $t$, we have $L = v_0 \\cdot t$. Substituting the expression for $L$ into the equation for $H$, we get:\n\n$H = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g \\cdot (\\frac{L}{v_0})^2$\n\nSolving for $t$, we have:\n\n$t = \\frac{L}{v_0} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2H}{g}}$\n\nThis result does not depend on $g$, the acceleration due to gravity. The reason for this is that the time at which the collision happens is determined by the horizontal distance the stone travels and the vertical distance the stone travels due to the initial speed $v_0$. The acceleration due to gravity affects the vertical distance traveled by the stone, but it does not affect the time at which the collision happens because both the stone and the cheese are subject to the same gravitational acceleration.",

The stone is thrown horizontally from the fox towards the crow with an initial speed $v_0$. The horizontal motion of the stone is uniform, so its horizontal velocity remains constant at $v_0$. The vertical motion of the stone is affected by gravity, causing it to accelerate downward with an acceleration of $g$.\n\nThe vertical motion of the stone can be described by the following equations:\n$$y_{\\text{stone}}(t) = H - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n$$v_{y,\\text{stone}}(t) = -gt$$\n\nNow, let's consider the motion of the cheese. The cheese is dropped by the crow at the same time the stone is thrown. Since the cheese is dropped, it has no initial vertical velocity and is only affected by gravity. The vertical motion of the cheese can be described by the following equations:\n$$y_{\\text{cheese}}(t) = H - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n$$v_{y,\\text{cheese}}(t) = -gt$$\n\nSince both the stone and the cheese have the same vertical position as a function of time, they will collide when their vertical positions are equal. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $y_{\\text{stone}}(t) = y_{\\text{cheese}}(t)$ to find the time at which the collision happens:\n$$H - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = H - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n\nThis equation is always true, regardless of the value of $g$, because the height of the tree and the effects of gravity cancel out in the equation. Therefore, the time at which the collision happens does not depend on $g$.\n\nTo compute the time at which the collision happens, we can set up the equation for the vertical motion of the stone and cheese and solve for $t$:\n$$H - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = H$$\n$$t^2 = \\frac{2H}{g}$$\n$$t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2H}{g}}$$\n\nTherefore, the time at which the stone and the cheese collide is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2H}{g}}$."
