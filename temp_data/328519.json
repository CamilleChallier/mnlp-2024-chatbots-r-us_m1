Now, in the inverted list, instead of only storing document identifiers of the documents in which the term appears, assume we also store an *offset* of the appearance of a term in a document. An $offset$ of a term $l_k$ given a document is defined as the number of words between the start of the document and $l_k$. Thus our inverted list is now:  $l_k= \\langle f_k: \\{d_{i_1} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]\\},  \\{d_{i_2} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_2}}]\\}, \\ldots,  \\{d_{i_k} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_k}}]\\} \\rangle$  This means that in document $d_{i_1}$ term $l_k$ appears $n_{i_1}$ times and at offset $[o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]$, where $[o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]$ are sorted in ascending order, these type of indices are also known as term-offset indices. An example of a term-offset index is as follows:  **Obama** = $\u27e84 : {1 \u2192 [3]},{2 \u2192 [6]},{3 \u2192 [2,17]},{4 \u2192 [1]}\u27e9$  **Governor** = $\u27e82 : {4 \u2192 [3]}, {7 \u2192 [14]}\u27e9$  **Election** = $\u27e84 : {1 \u2192 [1]},{2 \u2192 [1,21]},{3 \u2192 [3]},{5 \u2192 [16,22,51]}\u27e9$  Which is to say that the term **Governor** appear in 2 documents. In document 4 at offset 3, in document 7 at offset 14. Now let us consider the *SLOP\/x* operator in text retrieval. This operator has the syntax: *QueryTerm1 SLOP\/x QueryTerm2* finds occurrences of *QueryTerm1* within $x$ (but not necessarily in that order) words of *QueryTerm2*, where $x$ is a positive integer argument ($x \\geq 1$). Thus $x = 1$ demands that *QueryTerm1* be adjacent to *QueryTerm2*.  Consider the general procedure for \"merging\" two term-offset inverted lists for a given document, to determine where the document satisfies a *SLOP\/x* clause (since in general there will be many offsets at which each term occurs in a document). Let $L$ denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document. Assume we have a pointer to the list of occurrences of each term and can move the pointer along this list. As we do so we check whether we have a hit for $SLOP\/x$ (i.e. the $SLOP\/x$ clause is satisfied). Each move of either pointer counts as a step. Based on this assumption is there a general \"merging\" procedure to determine whether the document satisfies a $SLOP\/x$ clause, for which the following is true? Justify your answer.      1. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in $L$ regardless of $x$, and we can ensure that each pointer moves only to the right (i.e. forward).     2.
