The core of the recommendation system is a clustering algorithm aiming at regrouping\nbooks likely to be appreciate by the same person. This clustering should not only be achieved\nbased on the purchase history of customers, but should also be refined by the content of the books\nthemselves. It's that latter aspect we want to address in this exam question.\n\nConsider the following six 'documents' (toy example):\nd1: 'Because cows are not sorted as they return from the fields to their home pen, cow flows\nare improved.'\nd2: 'He was convinced that if he owned the fountain pen that he'd seen in the shop window for years, he could write fantastic stories with it. That was the kind of pen you cannot forget.'\nd3: 'With this book you will learn how to draw humans, animals (cows, horses, etc.) and flowers with a charcoal pen.'\nd4: 'The cows were kept in pens behind the farm, hidden from the road. That was the typical kind of pen made for cows.'\nd5: 'If Dracula wrote with a fountain pen, this would be the kind of pen he would write with, filled with blood red ink. It was the pen she chose for my punishment, the pen of my torment. What a mean cow!'\nd6: 'What pen for what cow? A red pen for a red cow, a black pen for a black cow, a brown pen for a brown cow, ...
